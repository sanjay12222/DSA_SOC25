# 📚 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Learning Plan

This repository documents my structured plan for learning and implementing data structures and Algorithms in C++. It includes my timeline, progress, and key resources.

---

## ✅ Topics Completed So Far

- **Basics of C++**
  - Syntax, Input/Output, control structures, functions
- **C++ STL (Standard Template Library)**
  - Vectors, pairs, maps, sets, priority queues, iterators
- **Arrays**
  - Declaration, initialization, traversal, problem-solving
- **Sorting Algorithms**
  - Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort
- **Searching Algorithms**
  - Linear Search, Binary Search, Two Pointer Technique
- **Time and Space Complexity**
  - Big-O, Ω, Θ notation, trade-offs

## 📅 Updated Plan of Action

Below is the revised plan based on current progress and remaining time:

| Deadline     | Topics                                           |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Till 29th June** | Recursion, Classes & OOPs, Strings          |
| **Till 6th July**  | Stack, Queue, Linked List                   |
| **Till 13th July** | Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree (BST), Heaps |
| **Till 20th July** | Graphs, Dynamic Programming                 |
